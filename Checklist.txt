### Checklist Purpose
###

	Hello. This checklist is going to operate in phases. During the initial
phase, the objective is to Note Ideas-and-design down naturally as they
are concieved, and complete tasks at bare minimum. If Ideas seem thorough, mark 
them as a task. If Ideas seem partially probable, mark them as Potential Tasks.
Due to the nature of the creative process this phase is in constant operation.


	During the Second Phase, the objective is to revisit each completed task
with the goal of polishing and tuning. This is the best way to do this. It is
important to not get caught up in Polishing and Tuning during the initial 
creation. We need to get things done, for starters. Also we cannot possibly
know the best iteration / polished form of a function or feature without having
the whole picture available to us. It simply makes sense.


1) Conceptualize
2) Create
3) Complete

	Once the initial concept is there, it can reasonably be analyzed. Proper
considerations on additional features can be made. I Cannot Stress This Enough.
