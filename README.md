# Druid #

3D Platformer made in Godot 4.1.3-stable. Target Platform is the Retroid Pocket 2S, an Android device with fair specs, and modern controller buttons (Dpad, ABXY, Start/Select, Bumpers, 2 Axis-Triggers, 2 clicking joysticks).

## Design ##

Will update later. For now there is a file called Checklist.txt which is functioning as both a management tool and brainstorm/design-doc.

## Playtest? ##

itch.io page : https://lettucepie.itch.io/project-druid

I plan on updating this distribution weekly, and maybe even providing developer notes/updates. This will eventually/hopefully be where the final official release is published.

### Where else? ###

Probably Google Playstore, since I think I still have an account set up with that from flicky-bee. F-Droid could be nice. Absolutely never Windows Appstore or Apple Anythingeverstore. Probably never on console... Switch could be cool, but publication requirements no thanks.
